            Hello! My name is Kristina Cecura. I was born in Germany, raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I currently
            live in Montreal, Canada. I graduated in Psychology at Bishop's University in 2020 and have work experience
            in data entry and visual effects. While working in Data I/O, I learned some basic command-line skills, which
            sparked my interest in coding. <br><br>
            I’m now pursuing full-time studies in Software Development and I’m passionate about web development. I enjoy
            creating projects from scratch and learning new technologies. I’m currently working on improving my
            front-end
            skills with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and I’m excited to grow further into full-stack
            development.
